This is to serve as a [b]${notice_level}[/b] notice to the defendant that bench trials are currently scheduled on multiple days throughout the week. Please notify the court if these times do not work for you. The expectation of the court is that each defendant file a notice for availability in the next 7 days. Date, times, and formatting shown [b][url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=3806]here[/url][/b]. [u]The courts will only provide the defendant three notices prior to involuntarily dismissing the case in favor of prosecution due to lack of response from the defendant.[/u]
 
Please note there is the possibility of a trial happening if defendants show up to City Hall and both a judge and defense attorney are available.

Due to a ${Reason}, the case will now be accepting the plea of guilty from the defendant. The defendant was given ample time to interact with the courts and file availability. If any of the dates and times did not align with the schedule of the defendant, they were able to contact the courts stating the like.

[center][font=Arial]IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF SAN ANDREAS

State of San Andreas v. ${Defendant}

[b]A decision was reached in the above case on the ${getFormalDate()}.[/b][/center]

The court will be granting the prosecutions/defenses request to hear this as a [i]Formal Criminal Trial[/i].  We are rescinding the order for discovery due to the transition of this case from bench trial to formal criminal trial. As such both parties will be notified when they are ordered to provide any evidence to the court via a new [i]Order for Discovery[/i] and set timeline for progress. The court thanks all parties for their patience in this matter.

At this time the court feels it imperative to give notice to the defendant on this case. As there is a limited availability and number of public defenders, we encourage those who can afford it to reach out to any private attorney for representation. It will be the responsibility of the defendant to retain representation privately or remain patient until a public defender becomes available.
